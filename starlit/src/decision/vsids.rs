//! VSIDS decision heuristic.
//!
//! This implements the (exponential) Variable State Independent Decaying Sum decision heuristic.
//! Conceptionally this maintains a score for each variable. For every conflict, the scores of a
//! small subset of variables are incremented by one, called bumping, followed by multiplying the
//! scores of all variables by a positive decay factor smaller than 1.
//!
//! When the sovler makes a heuristic decision, the unassigned variable with the highest score is
//! selected.
//!
//! This was introduced (with per literal scores and multiple conflicts inbetween decay steps) in
//! the solver Chaff (see ["Chaff: Engineering an Efficient SAT
//! Solver"](https://doi.org/10.1145/378239.379017)).
//!
//! To get an efficient implementation we need to avoid updating every variable's score every
//! conflict. As we are only interested in the relative order of scores and not their absolute
//! value, we can avoid this by rescaling. Instead of adding the constant 1 when bumping a score, we
//! add a variable `increment`, initially set to 1. Then instead of multiplying all scores by
//! `decay`, we divide `increment` by `decay`. The ratio of any two scores is the same as above.
//!
//! A small caveat is that eventually variable scores and/or `decay` will exceed the range
//! representable by floating point numbers. This needs to be detected, in which case all scores and
//! `decay` are multiplied by a small constant to keep them in range.
//!
//! This implementation strategy is due to MiniSat and explained in ["An Extensible
//! SAT-solver"](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24605-3_37).
//!
//! Initially, in Chaff and the first version of MiniSat, the set of bumped variables consisted of
//! the variables in the learned clause. Newer versions of MiniSat and most (all?) recent solvers
//! bump all conflict side variables instead (i.e. variables in the learned clause as well as
//! variables resolved on during learning). This seems to have been introduced by the solver BerkMin
//! (see ["BerkMin: A fast and robust SAT-solver"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.10.007)), but
//! many more recent descriptions of VSIDS describe this variant without explicitly pointing out
//! this change from the original approach.
//!
//! Finding the unassigned variable with the highest score is implemented using a heap data
//! structure. The heap always constains a superset of the unassigned variables. Assigned variables
//! are removed lazily, i.e. an assigned variable is removed when the highest score turns out to be
//! already assigned, but unassigned variables are added eagerly, i.e. as soon as they are
//! unassigned.
